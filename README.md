# Object Detection with YOLOv3

This project deploys a computer vision model trained to detect common objects in images using YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3), a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The model is served as an API using [fastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

## Features

- Object detection in images
- Good balance of speed and accuracy in identifying common objects
- Easy integration with existing projects using fastAPI

## Example

The image below demonstrates the object detection capabilities of the model. The model was able to accurately identify and locate the objects in the scene from the movie "The Batman (2022)".
